				<p>This is an advanced data mining page for popular Facebook game called <a href="https://www.mousehuntgame.com" target="_blank">Mousehunt</a>.

				<h3>What's the point of this site anyway?</h3>
				<p><a href="https://www.mousehuntgame.com" target="_blank">Mousehunt</a> is a popular social Facebook game, developed by  <a href="http://www.hitgrab.com" target="_blank">HitGrab, Inc</a>. So if you are not familiar with the game, the jargon might seem very unfamiliar.</p>

				<h3>Who is this site for?</h3>
				<p>This site is mostly for FB group admins that are devoted to Mousehunt game or to admins of non-official tournaments (competitions, shorty: comps).
				Most such people need to update a lot of statistics and spreadsheets, like who caught how much of which mouse. Updating stats for few hunters is rather straight-forward, but it gets very cumbersome if you have hundreds of hunters. That's where our "data parser" kicks in.</p>
			</div><!--/span-->

			<div class="span9">
				<h3>Put it simply in one sentence.</h3>
				<p>We provide extraction (=parsing) of data from hundreds of hunter profiles with a single click.</p>
			</div><!--/span-->

			<div class="span9">
				<h3>So who do I contact?</h3>
				<p>Send me <a href="mailto:bama@tirova.net">an email</a> and we'll discuss further details =)</p>
			</div><!--/span-->
			
			<div class="span9">
				<h3>OK, I'm an admin and I got my password. How do I start?</h3>
				<p>You first need to provide the list of hunters which will be parsed for you. This is done from the "Upload Hunters" page. Then you click on "Parse Data", which is the focal page of the site. If you have uploaded hunters data, they will be shown here in order they appear the file you have provided. 
				Pagination is limited to 20 hunters per page, to limit the server load. You simply click "Run Parser" and that's all there is to it. The system also saves parsed data in the database so next time you come back to the same page the data of the previous update will be shown.</p>

				<h3>What's up with these LG Treasure Maps?</h3>
				<p>In the <a href="https://www.mousehuntgame.com/newspost.php?news_post_id=139">Return of the Relic Hunter</a> MH devs deployed the <b>Living Garden Scroll Case</b>. 
				However, When you catch the Relic Hunter who drops this scroll and open the map, mice are ordered in alphabetical order and since there is up to 
				30 mice in 6 different locations it's rather difficult to know by heart where each mouse is to be hunted. 
				Enter <a href="http://bama.tirova.net/main/lgmaps">Living Garden Area Mice Locator</a>, where you simply copy remaining treasure map mice from the MH page and paste it in the input field. Hit the "Go!" button and that's all there is to it =) </p>
