## MH Parser ##

Live example: http://tirova.net

### Setup

* create a database from <code>assets/data/dump.sql</code>
* put DB credentials to <code>application/config/database.php</code>
* modify URI paths in <code>application/config/config.php</code>

### Dummy account

You can log in to the site with test/test. Parsing (scrapping) of data is currently disabled due to security issues.

### Todo

A lot of data that should be in DB is hardcoded in config files. Also, ideally I'd like to rewrite the code from bottom up with Node.js.
